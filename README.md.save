This is a small project created as an exercise in machine learning.  This
program generates arbitrary prices of items and the actual price of them.  

The machine learning algorithm takes the total price (the sum of the number of 
items multiplied by their respective price) and the number of items and 
attempts to find the individual price of each item via back propagation.

An example of an application of this would be purchasing a few items from a
store and not keeping the receipt.  The total price paid would either be known
since
it may show up on a debit/credit card statement or
